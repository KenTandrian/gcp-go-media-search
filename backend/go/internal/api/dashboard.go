// Package main contains the API route definitions for the server. This file specifically
// defines a placeholder for a future dashboard or statistics endpoint.
//
// Functions:
//   - Dashboard: Sets up a route group for statistics-related endpoints. Currently,
//     it defines a `/stats` endpoint that has no implementation.
package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

// Dashboard configures the API routes for a future statistics or dashboard feature.
// It creates a new route group "/stats" nested under the main API router group.
//
// Inputs:
//   - r: A *gin.RouterGroup to which the new "/stats" route group will be added.
//
// Outputs:
//   - This function does not return any value. It modifies the provided *gin.RouterGroup
//     by adding a new route handler.
//
// Current Implementation:
//   - It defines a GET endpoint at the root of the "/stats" group (e.g., /api/v1/stats).
//   - The handler for this endpoint is currently an empty function, meaning it will
//     return a 200 OK status with an empty body. It serves as a placeholder for
//     future logic that would fetch and return application statistics.
func Dashboard(r *gin.RouterGroup) {
	// Create a new router group for any statistics-related endpoints, prefixed with "/stats".
	stats := r.Group("/stats")
	{
		// Register a handler for a GET request to the "/stats" endpoint.
		stats.GET("", func(c *gin.Context) {
			// This is a placeholder for future implementation.
			// Currently, it does nothing and will result in a 200 OK response with an empty body.
			// TODO: Implement logic to fetch and return application statistics.
